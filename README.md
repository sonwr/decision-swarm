## Overview

Transforms one hard question into structured recommendations, dissent maps, and risk outputs.

Built for explicit disagreement handling and decision transparency.

## Why This Project

This repository exists to provide a practical, production-oriented foundation with clear operational visibility and repeatable workflows.

## Core Capabilities

- Structured runtime behavior with deterministic checks
- Ops-oriented scripts for health verification and reporting
- Clean handoff between development, validation, and reporting
- Incremental enhancements designed for continuous operation loops

## Tech Stack

`Node.js, TypeScript (planned), JSON/Markdown outputs`

## Quick Start

```bash
chmod +x scripts/ops-check.sh
./scripts/ops-check.sh
```

## Operations

```bash
DECISION_SWARM_REPORT_FILE=/tmp/report.json ./scripts/ops-check.sh
```

## Roadmap

- Improve monitoring depth and trend-based diagnostics
- Expand automation and report schema consistency
- Strengthen failure-mode handling and recovery behavior

## Security & Privacy

- Do not commit secrets, tokens, or private infrastructure details.
- Keep screenshots sanitized (no personal identifiers, no credential surfaces).
- Generated README images in this repo are synthetic and privacy-safe.
